For example, in a simple loop \\nlike we used in magicians.py , Python initially reads the first line of the loop:\\nfor magician in magicians:\\nThis line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list magicians \\nand store it in the variable magician. This first value is 'alice'. Python then \\nreads the next line:\\n    print(magician)\\nPython prints the current value of magician, which is still 'alice'. Because \\nthe list contains more values, Python returns to the first line of the loop:\\nfor magician in magicians:\\nPython retrieves the next name in the list, 'david', and stores that value\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5.5 (7.5.3)', 'creationdate': '2015-10-26T15:01:49-07:00', 'moddate': '2015-10-27T15:56:06-07:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Documents/books/python/python-crash-course.pdf', 'total_pages': 562, 'page': 86, 'page_label': '54'}, page_content='in magician.

Other \\ntimes you might be satisfied with just one condition being True. The keywords \\nand and or can help you in these situations.\\nUsing and to Check Multiple Conditions\\nTo check whether two conditions are both True simultaneously, use the key-\\nword and to combine the two conditional tests; if each test passes, the over -\\nall expression evaluates to True. If either test fails or if both tests fail, the \\nexpression evaluates to False.\\nFor example, you can check whether two people are both over 21 using \\nthe following test:\\nu >>> age_0 = 22 \\n>>> age_1 = 18 \\nv >>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21 \\nFalse'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5.5 (7.5.3)', 'creationdate': '2015-10-26T15:01:49-07:00', 'moddate': '2015-10-27T15:56:06-07:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Documents/books/python/python-crash-course.pdf', 'total_pages': 562, 'page': 112, 'page_label': '80'}, page_content='80   Chapter 5\\nw >>> age_1 = 22 \\n>>> age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21 \\nTrue \\nAt u we define two ages, age_0 and age_1. At v we check whether both \\nages are 21 or older. The test on the left passes, but the test on the right fails, \\nso the overall conditional expression evaluates to False. At w we change age_1 \\nto 22. The value of age_1 is now greater than 21, so both individual tests pass, \\ncausing the overall conditional expression to evaluate as True.\\nTo improve readability, you can use parentheses around the individual \\ntests, but they are not required. If you use parentheses, your test would look \\nlike this:\\n(age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21)\\nUsing or to Check Multiple Conditions\\nThe keyword or allows you to check multiple conditions as well, but it \\npasses when either or both of the individual tests pass. An or expression \\nfails only when both individual tests fail.\\nLet’s consider two ages again, but this time we’ll look for only one per-\\nson to be over 21:\\nu >>> age_0 = 22'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5.5 (7.5.3)', 'creationdate': '2015-10-26T15:01:49-07:00', 'moddate': '2015-10-27T15:56:06-07:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Documents/books/python/python-crash-course.pdf', 'total_pages': 562, 'page': 112, 'page_label': '80'}, page_content='>>> age_1 = 18 \\nv >>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21 \\nTrue \\nw >>> age_0 = 18 \\n>>> age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21 \\nFalse \\nWe start with two age variables again at u. Because the test for age_0 at v \\npasses, the overall expression evaluates to True. We then lower age_0 to 18. In \\nthe test at w, both tests now fail and the overall expression evaluates to False.\\nChecking Whether a Value Is in a List\\nSometimes it’s important to check whether a list contains a certain value \\nbefore taking an action. For example, you might want to check whether a \\nnew username already exists in a list of current usernames before complet -\\ning someone’s registration on a website. In a mapping project, you might \\nwant to check whether a submitted location already exists in a list of known \\nlocations.\\nTo find out whether a particular value is already in a list, use the key -\\nword \\nin.

This technique is \\nquite powerful because you can create a list of essential values, and then \\neasily check whether the value you’re testing matches one of the values in \\nthe list.\\nChecking Whether a Value Is Not in a List\\nOther times, it’s important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You \\ncan use the keyword \\nnot in this situation. For example, consider a list of users \\nwho are banned from commenting in a forum.

A Boolean expression is just another name for a \\nconditional test. A Boolean value is either \\nTrue or False, just like the value \\nof a conditional expression after it has been evaluated.\\nBoolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such \\nas whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on \\na website:\\ngame_active = True\\ncan_edit = False\\nBoolean values provide an efficient way to track the state of a program \\nor a particular condition that is important in your program.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5.5 (7.5.3)', 'creationdate': '2015-10-26T15:01:49-07:00', 'moddate': '2015-10-27T15:56:06-07:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Documents/books/python/python-crash-course.pdf', 'total_pages': 562, 'page': 114, 'page_label': '82'}, page_content='82   Chapter 5\\nt ry It y ourself\\n5-1.

If not, it uses the parameter’s default value. So when \\nyou define a default value for a parameter, you can exclude the correspond-\\ning argument you’d usually write in the function call. Using default values \\ncan simplify your function calls and clarify the ways in which your functions \\nare typically used.\\nFor example, if you notice that most of the calls to \\ndescribe_pet() are \\nbeing used to describe dogs, you can set the default value of animal_type to\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 9.9', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign CS5.5 (7.5.3)', 'creationdate': '2015-10-26T15:01:49-07:00', 'moddate': '2015-10-27T15:56:06-07:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Documents/books/python/python-crash-course.pdf', 'total_pages': 562, 'page': 170, 'page_label': '138'}, page_content='\\'dog\\'.

            "1. **Game Description**: The game is described as a space-themed shooter where the player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen, moving it left and right using the arrow keys and shooting bullets using the spacebar. The goal is to destroy a fleet of aliens moving across and down the screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Ship Creation**: The first phase of development involves creating a ship that can move right and left. The ship should also be able to fire bullets when the player presses the spacebar.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Alien Class Creation**: A class called `Alien` is created, which represents a single alien in the fleet. This class inherits from Pygame's `Sprite` class. The `Alien` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the alien and sets its starting position. The alien's image is loaded from a file named `alien.bmp` in the `images` folder, and its `rect` attribute is set.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Gameplay Mechanics**: The gameplay mechanics involve the player shooting and destroying aliens. If all aliens are destroyed, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous one. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. The game ends when the player loses three ships.\n",
